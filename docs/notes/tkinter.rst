Tkinter
=======

Install tkinter in mint:

..

        sudo apt-get install tk-dev python-tk

To get it work with pyenv all python versions should be installed after tkinter.  You can remove and reinstall a python version to get it to work in a virtualenv as well.

Perhaps I should start by creating a gui to save and load numpy arrays from a standard location.  A command line interface should be able to use the same code.
